## VPN Usage
The vpn will relay all internet connections over a server operated by oneofftech.
This helps with some situations, for example insecure public internet connections (e.g. Free WiFi in a CafÃ©), and might also improve network connectivity (by skipping routing decisions made by your ISP, and circumvent site-blocking)

Please note that the VPN will usually decrease your internet performance slightly, when compared to a direct connection to the internet.

Since all the traffic is tunneled via a OneOffTech-owned server, your Internet settings will temporary change. This changes will be reverted, when you disconnect.

We do not log or inspect any data transmitted via the VPN.
